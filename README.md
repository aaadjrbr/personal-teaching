#Interactive Pronunciation Guide: -S & -ED Endings


#Overview

This project is an interactive web-based guide designed to help English learners master the pronunciation of "-S" and "-ED" endings in English words. These endings, commonly used for plurals, third-person singular verbs, possessives, and past tense verbs, follow specific phonetic rules based on the final sound of the base word. The guide provides clear explanations, examples, and interactive quizzes to reinforce learning.
Features

Comprehensive Rules: Detailed explanations of the three pronunciation rules for both "-S" and "-ED" endings, including voiced, voiceless, and sibilant sounds.
Examples: At least five examples per rule, with phonetic transcriptions to illustrate correct pronunciation.
Interactive Quizzes: Two consolidated quizzes (one for "-ED" and one for "-S") with five questions each, covering all rules. Users can test their knowledge and receive immediate feedback.
Beautiful Modal: Quiz results are displayed in a visually appealing, theme-responsive modal with detailed feedback for each question.
Try Again Option: Users can reset and retake quizzes using the "Try Again" button.
Theme Support: Light and dark themes with a toggle button, plus an auto mode that adapts to the user's system preferences.
Customizable Fonts: Options to choose from four font families (Inter, Roboto Slab, Open Sans, Merriweather) via a settings panel.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.

#Purpose
